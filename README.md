# CS465-FullStack1
Architecture
•	Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
o	Express was used to serve the static files that the single-page application would then use to render the webpage.  In doing so it allowed for a webpage to be built that would continually be updated with the most current/relevant information while the user scrolled through the webpage.
•	Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
o	We used a NoSQL Mongo database for this project because it allowed for a tabular database to be built and would allow the information to be updated easier than recalling and updating all relationships, like you would in a SQL database.
Functionality
•	How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
o	JSON is derived from JavaScript but it’s purpose differs from it’s predecessor.  JSON can be generated or parse by most programming languages.  It’s a lightweight way to store and transport data for a web application.  JavaScript is the language that really adds life to a web site.  Without it there wouldn’t be much movement to the website.  So JSON acts as the transport object between the front and backend.
•	Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
o	Throughout the project we changed the majority of the code to make it functional, changeable, and reusable.  We did this by moving to html files and creating various components that would call the same NoSQL database from the various components.  In doing so it allowed us to be able to create admin accounts and user accounts to hold stored trips and add/edit trips.
Testing
•	Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
o	Utilizing outside programs to test the API endpoints is an important part of the full stack development.  Knowing how the program communicates with its various components is important in the security and safety of the web application.  Authenticating users, endpoints, and the movement of data, are key aspects in creating a application that is both secure and functional. 
Reflection
•	How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
o	This course has given me a fundamental start on full stack development.  With careful guidance throughout this course, I was able to create a functional full stack web application that utilized a SPA format and incorporated a reusable, updateable, and secure website.  While I’m far from mastery, I was given the tools to understand what full stack was about and how it could be used as I move into a career in software.  With web applications being a large component to the success of most businesses these days, I feel as though this class and the lessons I learned throughout it will help me in my career.
